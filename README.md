Project Overview

This project is a web-based academic review platform designed for AUB students to share and access honest feedback about courses and professors they have taken. The goal is to help students make better course registration decisions by providing reliable, centralized, and structured reviews.

The platform ensures that all feedback comes from verified AUB users, while maintaining anonymity to encourage honest and responsible participation.

Problem Statement

Students often rely on informal sources such as group chats or social media to learn about courses and professors. These sources are scattered, unreliable, and difficult to access when needed. Existing formal systems are limited and not easily accessible to students.

	•	Students can anonymously review course offerings
